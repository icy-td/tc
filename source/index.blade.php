    <h2>Welcome to TeslaCharts.net, a repository of the various Tesla-related data analyses provided by the fintwit Excel master, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/TESLACharts">@TESLACharts</a>.</h2>

    <p>In case you didn't know, "TC" as we Robinhood types like to call him, has an extensive background in solar technology, earned a Ph.D. in a related field, and likes to drink Coors Light on occasion. Other information about the man is spotty by design, but we do encourage you listen to his guest podcasts on Quoth the Raven.</p>
